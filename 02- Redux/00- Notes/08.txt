Currying in JavaScript transforms a function with multiple arguments into a 
nested series of functions, each taking a single argument. <---------- **

1. ... avoid passing the same variable again and again.
2. ... create a higher order function.

const sum = (a) => {
  return (b) => {
    return a + b
  }
}

const sum = a => b => a + b

console.log(sum(1001)(2002));
