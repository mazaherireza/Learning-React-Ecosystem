Introducing The Context API 
---------------------------
... a solution that can indeed get rid of this entire prop drilling problem altogether.

... React's Context API ... it is a feature that's ... to make sharing data across components and across component layers ... 
... create a context value ... you then provide that value ... wrap this context around multiple components, ...

... this context value that you provide to multiple components, ... it can easily be connected to state. <--------- **
So you can connect your React state to this context value which is provided to the entire application, ...

... components that do need to change or read the state, can directly reach out to that context, ... also to that state.
