Creating & Providing The Context
--------------------------------
src 
  store <---------- **

... context values are stored in files that are stored in a folder called "store".

cart-context.jsx
----------------
import { createContext } from "react";

export const CartContext = createContext();
...
... this value that is produced by createContext will actually be an object that contains a React component ... <--------- **

... initial value that can be provided to multiple components in your React App,
to all the components that will be wrapped by this context <------------- **

... App component is a greate place to wrap Header and Shop within our context 
so that those components or their child components can use that context.

... we're now going to use this context as a component.
... wrap it around the content that should be able to access this context.

App.jsx
-------
...
return(
  <CartContet>
    <Header cart={shoppingCart} ...>
      ...
  </CartContext>
... will work if you're using React 19 or higher, ...

... when using older versions of React, ... access a nested Provider property on that CartContext object ...

<CartContext.Provider> <-------------- **
... we're simply accessing a nested property on the CartContext object and that property turns out to hold a React component ...

... it's not just components like Header or Shop ... can be used like components as JSX elements ...
... but it's also nested components ...
