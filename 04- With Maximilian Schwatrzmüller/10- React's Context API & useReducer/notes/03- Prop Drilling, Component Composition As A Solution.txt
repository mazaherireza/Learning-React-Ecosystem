Prop Drilling, Component Composition As A Solution
--------------------------------------------------
... I want to embrace component composition by refactoring Shop component, to a wrapper around a list of Products.

... we no longer have to pass a pointer ... to the Shop component.
... a special children prop, so we can use this custom component (Shop component) as a wrapper ...

... got rid of one layer of component nesting, ...

... downside ...
... in the end, all your components just end up in the App component and all the other components are just wrapper components.
