Dispatching Actions & Editing State With useReducer
---------------------------------------------------
... the previous shopping cart value is now that state parameter ...
because this is guaranteed latest state we're getting from React, 

... if we had a more complex state object with multiple properties, we might wanna spread and copy the old state first
so that we don't lose any other values ... 

... reducer function outside of the React component,
and we don't have to keep in mind that we should use some special function forms (like updater function)
because in this reducer function we'll always get the latest state snapshot automatically. <-------------- **
