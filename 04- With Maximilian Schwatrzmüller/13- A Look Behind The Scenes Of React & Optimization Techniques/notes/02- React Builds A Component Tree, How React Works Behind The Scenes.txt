React Builds A Component Tree, How React Works Behind The Scenes
----------------------------------------------------------------
How does React update the DOM? <--------------- **
How are component functions executed? <--------------- **

... rendering a component to the screen ... means that React goes ahead and executes this CF.
... the App component is the first component ... that's being referenced in the main.jsx file,
which is the first code file to be executed when the website loads.

... every component function must return something that can be rendered, typically JSX code, 
sometimes also a portal or something like this, ...

... this JSX code ... translated to JS code and translated to actual elements that can be rendered on the screen, ...

... whenever such custom components are encountered (in JSX code that's being executed),
React goes ahead and executes those component functions from top to bottom, ...

React builds a component tree
-----------------------------
The relation between components is internally modelled as a tree structure. <----------- *

... but since this Header component does not contain any other custom components, 
this branch of the tree ends here.
