Avoiding Component Function Executions with Clever Structuring
--------------------------------------------------------------
memo, if used with care can be useful, but it's not the only way of preventing unnecessary renders.
Another technique that is often even more powerful than memo is a clever component composition ...

App.jsx
--------
...
<input type="number" onChange={handleChange} value={enteredNumber} />
...
... we could put this into a separate component, ... state that changes on every keystroke would also live in that separate component
and would not affect this App component.

ConfigureCounter.jsx
--------------------
...
const ConfigureCounter = ({ onSet }) => {
  ...
  const handleSetClick = () => {
    onSet(enteredNumber);
    setEnteredNumber(0);
  }
  ...
}

... state changes and re-executions of child components don't trigger parent component exectuions.

... we should actually also remove memo from the Counter because now memo is useless ...
