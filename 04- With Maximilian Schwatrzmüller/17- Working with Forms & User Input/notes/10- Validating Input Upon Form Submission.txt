Validating Input Upon Form Submission
-------------------------------------
... ref-based login form, we can also explore another way of validating user input.
... since I'm using refs, I can't really validate on every keystroke.
... I can basically only validate the input when the user submits the form.

... it's always a good idea to also add validation in handleSubmit function.
