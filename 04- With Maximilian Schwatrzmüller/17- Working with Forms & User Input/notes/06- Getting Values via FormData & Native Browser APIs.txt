Getting Values via FormData & Native Browser APIs
-------------------------------------------------
... another solution for extracting user input values, which can be more convenient to work with,
when dealing with more complex forms.

... call event.preventDefault to make sure that this automatically generated HTTP request is not being sent. <------- *

... create a special kind of object based on a special kind of constructor function that's built into the browser, 
the FormData constructor function.
... makes it easy to get hold of the different values entered into a form 

Signup.jsx
----------
const formData = new FormData(event.target);
formData.get("email"); 

... all those inputs for which you wanna extract values must have that name prop set on them ...

... quickly get hold of all the entered values, and group them together into an object ...
Object.fromEntries(formData.entries()) 

... calling entries on the FormData object will give us kind of an array of all the input fields and their values 
... calling Object.fromEntries on that array give us an object where we have key-value pairs for all our input fields.

... is missing ... a group of inputs ... 
... a group of checkboxes, which all have the same name ... an array of all the checked values, 
... such multi value input fields are lost when using entries and fromEntries. <------------- **
... get them back by manually extracting and storing them ...

const acquisitionChannel = formData.getAll("acquisition");
formData.acquisition = acquisitionChannel;
