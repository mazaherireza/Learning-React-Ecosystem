Resetting Forms
---------------
Signup.jsx
----------
...
<button type="reset" className="...>Reset</button>
...

Another way is to programmatically reset it.

function handleSubmit(event) {
  ...
  setEnteredValues({
    email: "",
    password: "",
  });
...
... when managing those values via state.

... when getting the entered values with refs, you can reset the inputs by manually setting the value property 
of the connected input elements to empty strings ...

... when working with refs it's typically better to reset the form 
as you can also can do it when using that FormData approach for extracting the values.

...
event.target.reset(); <--------- this is also some imperative code ...
