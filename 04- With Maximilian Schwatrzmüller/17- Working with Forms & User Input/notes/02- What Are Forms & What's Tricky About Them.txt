What Are Forms & What's Tricky About Them
-----------------------------------------
What's so difficult about forms?
... a form ... a collection of input fields, ...

... forms are about two main things you wanna do with them.
Form Submission                                                  Input Validation
Handling submission is relatively easy                           providing a good UX is tricky
Entered values can be managed via state                          ... validate on every keystroke -> errors may be shown too early
Alternatively, they can be extracted via refs                    ... validate on lost focus -> erros may be shown too long
Or via FormData and native browser features                      ... validate on form submission -> errors may be shown too late
