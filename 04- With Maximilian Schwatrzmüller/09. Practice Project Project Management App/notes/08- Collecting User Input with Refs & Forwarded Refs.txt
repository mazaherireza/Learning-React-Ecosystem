Collecting User Input with Refs & Forwarded Refs
------------------------------------------------
... we need a way of collecting these values that were entered into the inputs.
... one way ... listen to the change event and update some state with every keystroke and store the entered values ...

... since I really only wanna read these values when I click Save button ... use refs ... <--------- **
... you can use refs to connect them to HTML elements and then interact with those elements, ...

... this <Input ...> is a custom component, it's not a built-in input,
and therefore adding a ref prop might not work ... React version 19 or higher this will work
and you can simply use and extract this prop named ref ... like any other prop,
... wrap ... with forwardRef function ... forward any incoming refs <--------------- **

... we need that state lifted up to the App component.

... the connection should be established ...
