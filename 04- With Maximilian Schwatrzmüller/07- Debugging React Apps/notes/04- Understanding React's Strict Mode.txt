Understanding React's Strict Mode
---------------------------------
... another React feature, that can help you catch and fix some kinds of errors.

... this is an error, React can't surface to us immediately, right when the app starts,
it can do that if we use StrictMode.

... using StrictMode typically begins in index.jsx.
... you can also enable it just for parts of your application if you wanted to, ...

... StrictMode is a component provided by React ... use it like a component.
It is a component that's meant to be wrapped around other components.

index.jsx
---------
import { StrictMode } from "react";
...

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);

... one of the most important things the StrictMode component does is that 
it will execute every component function twice instead of just once. <-------------- **
... it only does that during development ... prepare your application for production 
and you would upload it to some server, StictMode would no longer execute every component twice ...
it does that during development.
