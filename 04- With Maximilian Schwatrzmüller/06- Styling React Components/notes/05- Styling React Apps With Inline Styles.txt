Styling React Apps With Inline Styles
-------------------------------------
... what can we do about that if we wanna achieve some scoping?
... switch to inline styles ... instead of defining CSS styles in a CSS file, 
you apply them right in your JSX code, by setting the style property just as you can set the style attribute in Vanilla HTML.

... style property takes a dynamic value ... {} ... pass an object as a value to the style property.

Inline Styles: Advantages & Disadvantages

Dynamic (conditional) styling is simple

No sepration between CSS & JSX code <------------ **
