Vanilla CSS Styles Are Not Scoped To Components
-----------------------------------------------
... this bottom paragraph here gets targeted by this rule, 
even though the bottom paragraph is defined in a different componnet in a different file.

... even if you do split your CSS code in multiple files, 
and you then do import some of these files into certain component files,
the CSS rules in those files will not be scoped to the components to which they belong
... all these styles are in the end just injected into the head section by Vite ... <---------------- **
they are applied globally to this page.
