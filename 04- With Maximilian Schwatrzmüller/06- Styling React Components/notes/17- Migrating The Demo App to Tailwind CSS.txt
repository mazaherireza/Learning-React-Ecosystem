Migrating The Demo App to Tailwind CSS
---------------------------------------
Tailwind CSS: Advantages & Disadvantages

Advantages
You don't need to know (a lot about) CSS
Rapid development
No style clashes between components since you don't define any CSS rules
Highly configurable & extensible

Disadvantages
Relatively long className values
Any style changes require editing JSX
You end up with many relatively small "wrapper" components or lots of copy & pasting
