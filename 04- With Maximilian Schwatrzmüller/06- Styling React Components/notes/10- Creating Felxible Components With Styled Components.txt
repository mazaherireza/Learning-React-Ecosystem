Creating Felxible Components With Styled Components
---------------------------------------------------
... you can mix and match styled components with other styling approaches like CSS modules without problems, ...

... I'll deliberately keep that className property on that styled component ...
... conditional styling still works, ... 

These components which you build with styled. (dot)
do not just use the children prop so that you can wrap them around content ... 
they also forward all props you're setting on this styled component 
to the underlying built-in JSX element ...
... for adding event listeners ... type prop on the input ...
