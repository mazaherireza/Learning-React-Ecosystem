Dynamic & Conditional Styling With Styled Components
----------------------------------------------------
What about setting styles dynamically or conditionally? <--------------- **
... we could add a special prop ... the name is up to you ...
... you can add any value you want, to that prop.
... you can use props set ... inside of your styles to dynamically alter those styles.

... with styled components, you can and should pass a function as a value ...
... values you inject into this string ... will in the end be picked up by that label function
... and would be executed and handled by the styled components package.

That's how these tagged templates work in the end.
If you inject dynamic values, those tagged template functions will receive those injected values as arguments.

... injecting props into styled components, ... don't accidentally clash with default built-in props 
that might exist on certain elements.

... invalid prop on the input element is a built-in prop.
... it is a common convention to prefix those props which you only want to use in your style component styling code with $ 
... this is still a valid prop name, ... won't clash with built-in props.
