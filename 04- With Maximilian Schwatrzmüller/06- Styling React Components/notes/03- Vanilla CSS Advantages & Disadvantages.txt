Vanilla CSS: Advantages & Disadvantages
---------------------------------------
Advantages
CSS code is decoupled from JSX code
You write CSS code as you (maybe) know and (maybe) love it
CSS code can be written by another developer who needs only a minimal amount of access to your JSX code

Disadvantages
CSS code is not scoped to components <----------------- **
CSS rules may clash across components 
(e.g., same CSS class name used in different components for different purposes)
