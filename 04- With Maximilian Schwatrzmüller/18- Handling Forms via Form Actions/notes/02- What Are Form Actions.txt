What Are Form Actions?
----------------------
Signup.jsx
----------
...
  function handleSubit(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); <---------- To prevent that browser default, O.W ... send an HTTP request.
  }

  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
    ...

...if you're using React 19+, ... set this function (handleSubmit) as a value for the action prop on the form element, ...

Signup.jsx
----------
...
  <form action={handleSubmit}>
    ...

... normally, when not using React, this action attribute would be used to define the path or the URL 
to which the browser sends the FormData when the form is submitted.

... in React, when adding the action prop to a form element, this is not what will happen.
... overrides this attribute (this prop), 
... will make sure that this function, (which you pass as a value to action), will be executed when the form is submitted. <----- *
... React behind the scenes call preventDefault ...so that browser default is suppressed and is not happening, 
... instead this function (handleSubmit) is executed.

... will no longer get an event object, ... this function when used as a value for the action prop, will get a formData object.

function handleSubmit(formData) { <--------- Contain all the submitted data, 
  const email = formData.get("email");

... name prop sets the key, ... used in the formData to extract the values.
...
  <input id="email" type="email" name="email" />

... the form was reset, ... React does automatically for you.

Signup.jsx
----------
...
const signupAction = formData => {
  const email = formData.get("email");
}
...
  <from action={signupAction}> <----------- *
