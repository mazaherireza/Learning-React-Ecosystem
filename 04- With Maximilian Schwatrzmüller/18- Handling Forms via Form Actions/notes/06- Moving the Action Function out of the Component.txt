Moving the Action Function out of the Component
-----------------------------------------------
You don't have to create these action functions inside of a CF.
... if in this action function, you're not using any component specific data (props, state),
you can absolutely take this function and move it out of this CF.

... you could also store this action function, in a totally different file ...
... make sense from a performance perspective because if the action function is inside of the compoent,
the action function will be re-created every time the CF executes. <----------- **

Of course, if you were using props or state in that action function, you would have to move it back into the CF.
