Registering Multiple Form Actions
---------------------------------
... vote buttons ... clicking these buttons would change vote count ...
... two buttons in one form. 
... when we click the buttons we actually wanna do differnt things.
So it may be the same form that is being submitted, but we wanna send different kinds of requests upon that form submission,
depending on which button was used.
... wanna have two form actions, one for each button, ... even though I have one form. <------------ **

... formAction functions can actually not just be set as values for the action prop of the form,
... buttons inside of a form and add the formAction prop to such a button and set that to an action function. <------- **

... trigger different formActions for different buttons.

Option.jsx
----------
function downvoteAction (formData) {}

...
<button formAction={downvoteAction}>
  ...

... that's how you can register multiple form actions for one single form if you have multiple buttons in there.
