Using the pending State from useActionState()
---------------------------------------------
How could we improve the UX?
... disabling these buttons after they have been clicked.
... I wanna disable both buttons if one of them has been clicked so that we have to wait for the vote to be registered,
before we can vote again.

We could use useFormStatus hook, ... but in order to do that 
we have to outsource these buttons into separate components. <-------- **

... another way of handling this, because instead of outsourcing these buttons, we can use the useActionState hook, 
... this hook also gives us pending information ... whether the form is currently being submitted.

Opinion.jsx
-----------
import { useActionState } from "react";
...
const [upvoteFormState, upvoteFormAction, upvotePending] = useActionState(upvoteAction);
...
<button formAction={upvoteFormAction} disabled={upvotePending || downvotePending}>
  ...
