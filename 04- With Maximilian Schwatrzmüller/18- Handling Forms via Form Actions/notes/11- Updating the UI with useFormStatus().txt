Updating the UI with useFormStatus()
------------------------------------
... this submit button would be disabled, and maybe the text on it would change whilst the form is being submitted.
... we have two main ways of adding such a feature ...
One way would be to use pending value ... will be true if the form is currently being submitted

NewOpinioin.jsx
---------------
...
const [formState, formAction, pending] = useActionState(...
async funtion shareOpinionAction(prevState, formData) {
  ...
  await addOpinion ... <------- pending will be true until this promise is resolved.

... another hook that's offered by React ...
A new hook that's meant to be used in conjunction with formActions.
... imported from react-dom ... useFormStatus hook. <----------- **
... can't be used in the component that contains the form and the formAction ... must be used in some nested component.
... some component that is used inside of this form ... <-------------- **

Submit.jsx
----------
import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom";

const { pending } = useFormStatus() <------- We'll get back an object that contains various pieces of information 
                                    about the current form status, ... form in which this component is being used.
...
{ pending ? "Submitting ..." : "Submit" }
