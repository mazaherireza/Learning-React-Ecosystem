Working With Asynchronous Form Actions
--------------------------------------
... it's time to submit the data to the backend if valid data has been entered.

NewOpinion.jsx
--------------
...
function shareOpinionAction(prevState, formData) {
  ...
  await addOpinion(...
...

... addOpinion is an async function, ... therefore what we might wanna do in our formAction ... await ...
so that we only clear the form, after the data has been submitted to the backend. <------------ **
This will also become important later once we update the UI based on the current submission status.

... form actions can be both synchronous or asynchronous functions.
... though if it is an asynchronous function, React will actually wait 
for the promise that is returned by this action function to resolve
before it internally marks this form as submitted. <------------ *
