Forwarding Refs to Custom Components
------------------------------------
How can we reach out to this dialog from TimerChallenge with help of a ref? <---------------- **

..., we're in the end, forwarding a ref that's defiend in TimerChallenge ..., to the dialog element in ResultModal.

... the built-in dialog element has such a showModal method, ... standard browser feature.
... this is only the case because this project uses at least version React 19.
... older React versions, you would have gotten an error.

Warining: ResultModal: `ref` is not a prop.
... can't accept a ref like a regular prop. <------------ **
... how you would set up this component to receive a ref, if you couldn't use this approach.

... wrap your component function with ... forwardRef, ... this component function then 
receives an additional parameter. ... a second parameter beside receiving props parameter.

ResultModal.jsx
---------------
import { forwardRef } from "react";

const ResultModal = forwardRef({ result, targetTime }, reference) => {
  return (
    <dialog ref={reference} className="result-modal">
    ...
)
