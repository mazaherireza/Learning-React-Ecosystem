Adding a Modal Component
------------------------
... I wanna show a pop-up that lets us know about our result ... 

... if you add a form like this, (with the method set to dialog) inside of a dialog,
a button that submits the form, will close this dialog.

Modal.jsx
---------
...
<dialog>
  <form method="dialog">
    <button>Close</button>
  </form>
</dialog>

... this built-in dialog element by default is invisible ... open prop to it. <----------- **

... we could manually add another element, that is displayed behind that dialog ... used to dim that background behind the dialog ...
... but this dialog comes with a built-in backdrop element that will be displayed behind the dialog
... this built-in backdrop will not be shown if you force the dialog to be visible <--------------- **
by setting open to true ...
Instead we have to open this dialog programmatically by sending a command to the browser,
... to get this built-in backdrop ... refs can help us. <--------------------- **
... we can access this dialog from inside the TimerChallenge (parent) component.
