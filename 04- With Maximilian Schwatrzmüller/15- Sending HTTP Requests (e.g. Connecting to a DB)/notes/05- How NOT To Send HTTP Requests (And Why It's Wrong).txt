How NOT To Send HTTP Requests (And Why It's Wrong)
--------------------------------------------------
... fetch is a function that can be used to send an HTTP request to some other server.

fetch("http://localhost:3000");
... this URL will target my running backend server.

... fetch returns a promise, which is a JS value that will eventually resolve to another value.
So it's basically a wrapper object around a value that's not there yet but that will eventually be there.
... a promise is a standard JS object that will yield different values (depending on the state of that promise)
and to access those different values you can chain methods on the result of calling fetch.
...

... in modern JS, you can also use that await keyword ... this is only available if the function in which this code executes
is decorated with async, ... is not allowed for CFs.

...

... when calling fetch directly in the CF, 
... executes every time the CF executes and therefore a new request would be sent whenever this CF executes.
The problem is ... in the second block we then update the state, which causes this CF to execute again. <-------- **
