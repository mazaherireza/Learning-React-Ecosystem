Module Introduction
-------------------
... it's indeed quite common that you need to build projects where the data is centrally managed on some server 
so that users from all over the world can operate on that data and can maybe also change that data.

If you're trying to build something like Facebook ... you can't manage the data inside of the React project 
because that React project code, in the end, gets executed inside of the browsers of your visitors.  
... each have their own copy of the React project running in their browser, but they can't interact with each other. 
They can't exchange data ...

Some data must be managed centrally <------------ **
-----------------------------------
Centrally managed data
e.g., images, user data, product data, ... 
Server (Backend) <------- Owned & operated by you

Client (Frontend)
Clients communicate (e.g., send data, fetch data) via HTTP requests
React app runs in the browser of your user (website visitor)
-> Any data changes only happen locally (and are only stored locally)

Data Fetching & HTTP Requests
-----------------------------
Sending & Receiving data via HTTP
... how your React apps can get and send data from and to such central servers
so that you're not limited to building React apps that work with local dummy data, ...
