Sending HTTP Requests (GET Request) via useEffect
-------------------------------------------------
...
places.json
-----------
... if we take a look at the raw data that's fetched, ...

{
  ...
  "image": "forest-waterfall.jpg", <----- just contains the name of the image file
  ...
... those images files are now actually stored in the backend project, ... in images folder.
... we need to access those images ...

We can't send direct requests to images folder 
because by default all that backend project code and file structure is inaccessible ...
We can only send the kind of requests that are explicitly allowed by the backend code.

... construct a URL where we point at the backend with localhost:3000 and then the image file name.

Places.jsx
----------
...
<img src={`http://localhost:3000/${place.image.src}`} ...
... send a request for this image file to the backend.
