What & Why
----------
Class Components vs Functional Components
-----------------------------------------
...
Components are regular JS functions which return renderable results (typically JSX)

... there is an alternative way of defining components.

... you can define a component by creating a class, ... with a render method 
... React will call that render method to evaluate what should be rendered to the screen.

Components can also be defined as JS classes where a render method defines the to-be-rendered output
... class-based components

Traditionally, you had to use class-based components to manage state <-------- when using React prior to version 16.8

React 16.8 introduced React Hooks for functional components
Class-based components can't use React Hooks
