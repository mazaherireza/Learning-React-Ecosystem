The Component Lifecycle (Class-based Components Only!)
------------------------------------------------------
... there are specific methods you can add to class-based components to run code at different points in that life cycle.

componentDidMount()
Like render that's a built-in method, which you can use as soon as you extend the built-in Component ...
... React will call it for you when the component was just mounted.

componentDidMount()    called once a component mounted 
                       -> evaluated & rendered by React           useEffect(..., [])

... every effect function is executed when the component first is mounted.
But if you have no dependencies ... empty dependencies array, the effect function is only executed in that case.

componentDidUpdate()  called once a component updated
                      -> re-evaluated & re-rendered by React      useEffect(..., [someValue])

... whenever the dependencies change, the effect function re-executes and the dependencies are re-evaluated 
when the component is re-evaluated and was rendered again.

componentWillUnmount() called right before component is unmounted
                       -> right before removed from DOM            useEffect(() => { return () { ... } }, [])
