Optimizing State Updates
------------------------
... every 10 miliseconds, React has to compare the onConfirm value to figure out whether this effect function should run again.
... re-evaluate this entire JSX code ...

It would be better to outsource this progress indicator and its related state logic and useEffect hook 
into a separate component ... just one single component that should be re-executed all the time.
