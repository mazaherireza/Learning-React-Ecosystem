useEffect Not Needed Another Example
------------------------------------
... fetch these items when the App starts. 
... you might think that you probably need useEffect, 

... when we add an empty dependencies array, effect function will only run once, after the App CF ran. <---------- **
... redundant usage of useEffect. <---------------- *

... localStorage ... runs synchronously, which means it basically finishes instantly. <------------- **
It executes line by line ... this was not the case for getCurrentPosition
... it was only done once this callback function was executed by the browser and that happened at some point in the future.

But for localStorage, that's not the case, we got no callback function or promise ...
... this App component function does not finish its execution cycle, before fetching that data is done.

... get rid of useEffect ... move that code in front of the state initilization code ... 

... move that code out of the component function, so that it only runs once in the entire application lifecycle, 
when this code file is parsed and executed for the first time.

... with side effects that don't need useEffect.
