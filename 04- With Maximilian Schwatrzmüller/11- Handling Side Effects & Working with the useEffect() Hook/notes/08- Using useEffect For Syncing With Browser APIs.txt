Using useEffect For Syncing With Browser APIs <---------------- **
---------------------------------------------
How can we use useEffect to make sure depending on the value of this open prop, this dialog is shown or closed?
We could first try it without useEffect ... add if check ...
... we'll get an error ... Cannot read properties of undefined (reading "close") at Modal ...
... the first time this CF executes, this ref won't be set yet. <-------------- **
... because JSX code hasn't executed yet.
So connection between ref and dialog element hasn't been established yet. <--------------- **
... another scenario where you wanna use useEffect ... can help you synchronize prop or state values to DOM APIs <----------- **
like this dialog showModal method .... 
... because the effect function you define with useEffect will be executed right after the component function 
and since it executes after the CF ... this connection between the ref and the dialog will be established ... <------------- **

... to synchronize some value, (the open prop) to a DOM API or to a certain behavior.

... haven't added all the dependencies that are required by this effect function to dependencies array. <--------- **
What exactly are such effect dependencies?
