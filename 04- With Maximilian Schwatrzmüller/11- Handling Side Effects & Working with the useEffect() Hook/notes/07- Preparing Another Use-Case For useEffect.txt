Preparing Another Use-Case For useEffect
----------------------------------------
... we switch from managing the modal in an imperative way to managing it in a declarative way.

... but the backdrop is actually missing.
... this backdrop is only added by the dialog element if we open it by calling the dialog's showModal method.
So ... forwarding open prop to the dialog ... does not really work.
But we can still stick ot this prop focused solution by using useEffect. <------------- **
