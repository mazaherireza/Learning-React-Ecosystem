Understanding Effect Dependencies
---------------------------------
Effect dependencies are prop or state values that are used inside of the effect function. 
[In addition, other effect dependencies would be functions or context values that depend on or use state or props.] <----------- **
... any value that causes the component function to execute again, <----------- **
which is the case in the end for props and states, any such value is a dependency,
if it's used inside of useEffect. <----------- **

Any other value like refs ... objects and methods that are built into the browser, are not considered dependencies.
Because useEffect only cares about dependencies that would cause the component function to execute again. <------------ ***

... effect function should run whenever the component function executed if one of its dependencies changed.

... with an empty dependencies array, effect function would never run again. <------------- **

... this effect function will now run again whenever the Modal CF executed and the value of the open prop changed.
