A Potential Problem With Side Effects, An Infinite Loop
-------------------------------------------------------
... those sorted places, are not available right at the start, 
because this operation of getting the user's location will take some time. 
So the first App component render cycle, will be finished at the point of time where we have this location. <----------- **
Therefore we need state here, ...
... setAvailablePlaces(...) triggers a new render cycle, the state will be updated with those sorted places
... it would cause an inifinite loop.

..., calling such a state updating function tells React to re-execute the component function ... 
... we fetch the user's location again ...
... crash our application ... useEffect hook ... allows us to solve this problem. <----------- **
