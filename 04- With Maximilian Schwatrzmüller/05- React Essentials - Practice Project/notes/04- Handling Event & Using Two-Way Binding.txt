Handling Event & Using Two-Way Binding
--------------------------------------
... useState, ... register and manage some state in a component.

... one state object ... merges all these different input values into one object.
... one generic function that can actually be connected to all inputs.
...
... because by default when the change event occurs, 
React will call this function and pass the event object to it, a default event object that is automatically generated by React.
