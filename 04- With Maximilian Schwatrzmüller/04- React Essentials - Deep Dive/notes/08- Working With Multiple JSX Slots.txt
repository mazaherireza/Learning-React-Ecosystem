Working With Multiple JSX Slots
-------------------------------
... special Tabs component ...
... in bigger apps, it would not be unreasonable to assume that we might have different places
in the app where tabs like this might be used ...

... wrapper component that just enforces a certian JSX ...
... the idea behind this component is that we could use it for all kinds of tabs
with all kinds of content in different places of the app.

... this should be a relatively dump wrapper component which doesn't know anything about the content it's managing.

... adding extra props does not just add some extra complexity ...
makes Tabs less reusable ...

... pass them as JSX code <--------------- **
... just as we're passing dynamic content to Tabs.

The problem here is that we only have one special children prop, and we're using that for the content.
... need some additional prop to get buttons which should be inserted between menu tags.
... we wanna have an additional slot for JSX code <------------- **

<Tabs buttons={<--------- Some JSX code}> <--------------- **
... JSX elements are in the end regular values ...

... the main content slot, which is set with help of children and then this buttons slot,
which is set with help of our custom buttons prop.
