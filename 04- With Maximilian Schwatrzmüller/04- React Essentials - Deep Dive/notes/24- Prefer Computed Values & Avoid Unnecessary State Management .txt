Prefer Computed Values & Avoid Unnecessary State Management 
-----------------------------------------------------------
... functional approach ... the new array will depend on the old array.
... updating this in an immutable way ...

... doing that, is not optimal because when using activePlayer here,
we're technically merging two different states and <--------------- **
we're using this function form for updating the gameTurns state 
... to make sure that when the schedule state update is performed, 
we're definitely working with the latest state but we don't have that guarantee for activePlayer 
because that's from a different state.

... a better way of deriving the symbol ... is to add a new variable ... 

... we're not merging different states.
