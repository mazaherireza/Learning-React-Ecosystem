You Don't Have To Use JSX!
--------------------------
... JSX code, HTML in JavaScript code ...
... a non-standard feature, it's not supported by the browser ... we got a build process, 
... you could also build React apps without using JSX, 

You Don't Need JSX (But It's Convenient)
----------------------------------------
... you could replace this JSX code,

<div id="content">
  <p>Hello World!</p>
</div>

which you might return in a component, with this code which does not use JSX at all, 

React.createElement(
  "div", <---------- Component Type, Identifies the to-be-rendered component
  { id: "content" }, <------ Props Object, Sets component props
  React.createElement( <------ Child Content, The content passed between the component tags
    "p",
    null,
    "Hello World"
  )
);

... only uses standard JS features.

JSX
Requires build process & code transformation
Easy to read & understand

Without JSX
Works without special build process & transformation
Pretty verbose & not necessarily intuitive

index.jsx
---------
... 
ReactDOM.createRoot(entryPoint).render(React.createElement(App)); <--- A valid alternative to JSX code
