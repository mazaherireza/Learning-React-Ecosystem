Component Instances Work In Isolation
-------------------------------------
... whenever you're using or reusing a component,
React will basically create a new isolated instance. <------------- **
... they work totally isolated from each other. <------------- **

... we have a shared component with the same logic inside of it, 
but then once you use that component, totally different isolated instances are created
which only use the same logic but they then use it on their own.
