Forwarding Props To Wrapped Elements
------------------------------------
... destructuring ... 
({ title, children, ...rest }) 
This JS feature is called "Rest property".
This syntax, groups all remaining object properties into a new object (named "rest" in this case).

"..." tells JS to collect all other props that might be received on this component and merge them into a rest object.

<section {...rest} <------ Spread operator 
... all extra props that might be set to our component will be forwarded to this built-in section element.

... very useful pattern when building wrapper components ... <------------- **

... the onClick prop which exists on built-in button to which we're forwarding those leftover props.
... to use that same prop forwarding pattern.
