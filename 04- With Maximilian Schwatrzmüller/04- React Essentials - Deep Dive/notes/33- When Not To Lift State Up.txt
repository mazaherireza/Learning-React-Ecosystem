When Not To Lift State Up
-------------------------
... playerName state is actually used to update this input field on every keystroke
And if we would move it out of the Player component ... the entire App component is reevaluated 
on every keystroke .... in addition, lifting this playerName state out of the Player component
also of course would be tricky ... we're using this Player component twice 
and every component should manage its own name.
