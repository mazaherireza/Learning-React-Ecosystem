Not All Content Must Go Into Components
---------------------------------------
... this index.html file is in the end the file that's going to get served to the visitors of your website.

... when working with React, you can still add more markup to this file if you need ... 
If you got some markup that could be put into a component but that really doesn't have to be inside of a component 
because it might not depend on props or any state that might change ... 

... static data like this header ... put it right into the index.html file 

... all the files that are stored in the public folder will always be available to website visitors. <------- ***
... reference these files ... from inside your markup, 
no matter if it's in a component or in the index.html file ... by simply specifying the name of the file ... <------- ***

... all these files in the public folder will be served alongside the index.html file to website visitors.
... reference by name and you don't have to build a path ... 
... these files will automatically be surfaced to the root of web application when being served to your website visitors.
