Problem, Props Are Not Forwarded To Inner Elements
--------------------------------------------------
... crucial React features ...

Additional Key Component & Props Concepts
_________________________________________
Forwarded props
Multiple component slots
Element identifiers as props
default prop values

... we could therefore build a separate Section component that always enforces this structure ...

... the styling doesn't look correct anymore, ...
... when you're setting props, so attributes, on a custom component 
those props are not automatically forwarded to the JSX code used inside of that component.
... there is no magic connection like this.
React is only setting the props on the elements where the developer are setting them. <------------ **

... is basically just lost, it's ignored.

Props Are Not Forwarded Automatically
-------------------------------------
Examples Component
<Section id="examples" />

Section Component
<section> <------------ id is ignored 
...
</section>
Props must be used & set explicitly <---------------- ***
...
<section id={id}> 
...

... this is not really scalable and not really convenient.
... pattern that would be called forwarded props or proxy props.
