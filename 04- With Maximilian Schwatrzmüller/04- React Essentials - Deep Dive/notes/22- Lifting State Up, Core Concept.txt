Lifting State Up, Core Concept
------------------------------

Lifting State Up
----------------
Lift the state up to the closest ancestor component 
that has access to all components that need to work with that state <----------- **

Ancestor Component <---- State (State value that's needed by both Child1 & Child2

Ancestor Component <----------- Manages
Child Component <-------------- Needs

Ancestor passes the state value via props to the child component
Ancestor passes a function that eventually changes the state, via props to the child component
This allows the child component to initiate the state change <--------------- **

... the App component can then pass the information which player is currently active to both components via props.
