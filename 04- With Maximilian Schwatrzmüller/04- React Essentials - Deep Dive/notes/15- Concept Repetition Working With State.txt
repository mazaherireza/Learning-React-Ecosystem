Concept Repetition Working With State
-------------------------------------
... state ... we wanna manage some data that in the end, should cause the UI to update when changed.

const [isEditing, setIsEditing] ...
... I plan to store the information whether we currently are editing the player or not in this state.

... if some child component changes, the parent component does not care about that. <------------ **

... you can store JSX code as a value in variables.
