Deriving Values, Outputting Questions & Registering Answers
-----------------------------------------------------------
... it's always the first answer that's correct, ... when we display those answers to the user we therefore wanna shuffle them ...

Why is this way of managing the state not optimal? <-------------- **
... I plan to have two state snapshots here, ... one of the two pieces of state here is redundant ...
... we'll need to store the answers picked by a user but when it comes to the activeQuestionIndex, 
that could actually be derived from this userAnswers array ... <---------- **
Because here we'll store one answer for every question ... take a look at the number of stored answers in this array,
and we can derive what the currently activeQuestionIndex should be ...

... a computed value ... 
const activeQuestionIndex = userAnswers.length; <-------------- **

... you typically want to manage as little state as possible and derive as much state as possible instead.
