Moving Logic To Components That Actually Need It (Moving State Down)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
... we fixed this problem with our key but we also kind of added a new problem, 
because we have to pass a lot of props that are managed in the Quiz component to the Question component ...

... the answerState, why does this need to happen here in the Quiz component? <------------- **
... it doesn't. That's a great example for a state that does not need to be lifted up.

Question.jsx
------------
...
const [answer, setAnswer] = useState({
  selectedAnswer: "",
  isCorrect: null,
});
...

... in our Question component, we can therefore destructure this key prop and also use it ...

... Quiz.jsx ... derive activeQuestionIndex just based on userAnswers.length ...
