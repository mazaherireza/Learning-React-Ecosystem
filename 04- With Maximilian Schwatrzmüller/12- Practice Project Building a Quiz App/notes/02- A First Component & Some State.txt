A First Component & Some State
------------------------------
Header.jsx
----------
import logo from "../assets/logo.png";
...
<img src={logo} ...

... with that import ... (logo), ... in most React projects, this Vit-based project ..., 
I can set the source of the image to this imported image ...
project setup will then figure out and inject the path to the potenially optimized image behind the scenes. <----------- **

... Quiz component ... show the currently active question to the user and when the question was answered by the user
I wanna switch to a differnt question.
... responsible for switching between questions and registering user answers.

... I wanna store those answers. therefore ... need to manage some state ... register those answers, ...

Quiz.jsx
--------
...
const [activeQuestionIndex, setActiveQuestionIndex] = useState(0);
const [userAnswers, setUserAnswers] = useState([]);
... not necessarily the best way.
