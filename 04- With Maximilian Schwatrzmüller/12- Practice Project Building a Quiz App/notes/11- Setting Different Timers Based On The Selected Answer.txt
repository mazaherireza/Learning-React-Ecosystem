Setting Different Timers Based On The Selected Answer
-----------------------------------------------------
... if I pick an answer a little bit too late, ... timer up here might actually expire before I learn whether it's right or wrong.
We simply might move alogn too quickly ...
... seem to run into some problems where we got multiple timers going on at the same time. <------------ ?

Because whenever we pick an answer, ... setting a timer ... in the Question component.
... two nested timers ... once inner timer expired, which happens after we marked an answer as right or wrong,
we forward the selected answer to the parent component, ... Quiz component ...

But that ... means that if this timer (in QuestionTimer component) expires, 
before the right or wrong answer is forwarded to the parent component,
we switch to a different question because the timer expired and then again,
because now the actually selected answer was forwarded to the parent component.

... in the Quiz component, we got these two different situations 
where we do switch to a different question because we stored a selected answer.

One way of moving to the next question and storing an answer is
if an answer was skipped because the timer expired,
The other way is ... we received an answer from the user ...
... both things happen if we select an answer too late. <------------ **

... Question component, ... update this timer if the user did select an answer, so that we start a new timer, 
... that only expires after we showed the user the right or wrong answer. <-------------- **
... if that timer then expires, I also don't wanna tell the Quiz component that the question was not answered, ...

So to update the timer, once an answer was chosen, we can add a new computed value ... Question component ...

... add key to QuestionTimer ... when we change the timer value,
we destroy and recreate the QuestionTimer component and force the interval to be recreated, ...
