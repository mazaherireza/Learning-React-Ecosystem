Storing Component's Styles Files Next To Components
---------------------------------------------------
... split this CSS file into multiple smaller component-specific CSS files.

... React and this project setup does not automatically include this CSS file in the loaded webpage.

... thanks to that underlying build process, this import statement will be processed 
and the CSS code will be included in the loaded webpage.

... importing such a CSS file in a component file will not scope these styles to that component, 
... are not scoped and limited to this component <--------------- **

Splitting the CSS code into components-sepcific CSS files can still make sense ...
... limitation ... that these styles will not automatically be restricted to this components.
