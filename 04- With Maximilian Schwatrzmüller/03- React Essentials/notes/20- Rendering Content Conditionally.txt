Rendering Content Conditionally
-------------------------------
... we need to output some content conditinally.
... output some fallback text, ... <---------------- **
... use a ternary expression.

!selectedTopic <------------- if it's not truthy

{ !selectedTopic ? <p>Please select a topic.</p> : null }
... null is something you can output in JSX code, it'll simply lead to nothing being rendered here.

Logical and operator

{!selectedTopic && <p>Please select a topic.</p>}

&& will actually output the value that comes after it if the condition in front of it yields true.

... the last alternative ... use a variable.
... JSX ... you can use it as a regular value anywhere in your component code.
...
let tebContent = <p>Please select a topic.</p>
if(selectedTab) {
  tabContent = ...
}
....
{tabContent}
