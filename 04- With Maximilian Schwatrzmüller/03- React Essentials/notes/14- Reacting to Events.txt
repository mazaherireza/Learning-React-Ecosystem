Reacting to Events, Core Concept
--------------------------------
... we don't want to write imperative code ...

... by adding special attribute, special prop to elements.
... props because those built-in elements are also just components.
... onClick prop. ... listen to a broad variety of events.
... the value for any event prop, is a function ... that should be executed when the event occurs.
...
function handleClick() {}

The advantage of defining these event handler functions inside the component function
is that they then have access to the component's props and state. <------------ **

<button onClick={handleClick} ...  <----------- must not executed ... you want to use the function as a value.
... it should executed by React when a click on this button occurs ...
