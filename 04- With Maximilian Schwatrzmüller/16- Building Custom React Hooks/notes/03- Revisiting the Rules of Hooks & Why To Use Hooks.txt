Creating a Custom Hook
----------------------
... functions that start with use are treated as hooks. <------ *
... rules of hooks are enforced on such functions ...

... the idea is that in the end later, we'll be able to get rid of useEffect in App.jsx ...
... use our custom hook and that will then internally perform all the work we stored in there ...
... our CF therefore got leaner.
