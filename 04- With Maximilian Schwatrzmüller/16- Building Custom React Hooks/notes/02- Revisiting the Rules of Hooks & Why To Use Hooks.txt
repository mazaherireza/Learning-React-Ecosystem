Revisiting the Rules of Hooks & Why To Use Hooks
------------------------------------------------
Rules of Hooks - Updated
1) Only call hooks in component or other hook functions
2) Only call hooks on the top level

Why would you build custom hooks and what should these custom hooks do?
... wrap and reuse code that goes into your component functions.

... outsource and make more generic so that we can reuse it, ... have one reusable configurale function ...

... we can't put it into a separate component because this is just a part of a component 
it does not return JSX code or anything like that 

... custom hooks will also be functions that we can then call from different places, 
but they will be functions that are guaranteed to be used in valid places, ... (components).
